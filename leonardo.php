  <h6 class="bio-header">Early life</h6>
    <p class="bio-para">Born on November 11, 1974, in Los Angeles, California, Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio is the only child of 
    Irmelin and George DiCaprio. His parents divorced when he was still a toddler. DiCaprio was mostly raised by his mother, a
     legal secretary born in Germany. Despite his parents' early divorce, DiCaprio remained close to his father, a comic book 
     artist and distributor. With his parents' urging, DiCaprio explored his creative side, developing an early interest in acting.
      "I loved imitating people ... I loved joking around with my parents and creating different characters. I liked doing my own 
      little homemade skits," DiCaprio told Backstage. But he didn't have much success in Hollywood until he reached his early teens.
