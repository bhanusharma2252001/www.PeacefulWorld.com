<h6 class="bio-header">Who Is Dilma Rousseff?</h6>
<p class="bio-para"> Dilma Rousseff in full Dilma Vana Rousseff, (born December 14, 1947, Belo Horizonte, Brazil), 
Brazilian politician who in 2011 became Brazil’s first female president. She was reelected in 2014 but impeached and 
removed from office in 2016.
</p>
  <h6 class="bio-header">Early life</h6>
    <p class="bio-para"> Rousseff was raised in an upper-middle-class household. Her father was a lawyer who immigrated to Brazil 
    from Bulgaria, and her mother was a teacher. In 1964 Brazil’s president was overthrown by a coalition of civilian and military 
    officials, and the teenaged Rousseff became involved in the left-wing opposition to the government. She was associated with the
     militant group National Liberation Command (Comando de Libertação Nacional; Colina), and she married fellow activist Cláudio
      Galeno Linhares in 1968. After a raid on a Colina safe house resulted in police fatalities, the pair went into hiding in Rio de
       Janeiro. She and Galeno later fled Rio de Janeiro for Porto Alegre, subsequently separated, and in 1981 divorced. Rousseff 
       moved to São Paulo, and it was there in 1970 that she was arrested by government forces. She was imprisoned for three years
        on the charge of subversion and during that time was subjected to torture by her captors.
Upon her release in 1973, Rousseff resumed her education; she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in economics from the Universidade
 Federal do Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre in 1977. As the grip of the dictatorship weakened, Rousseff became active in local 
 politics, and she was appointed finance secretary for Porto Alegre in 1986. She left that position in 1988 and later spent two 
 years as president of the Foundation of Economics and Statistics of Rio Grande do Sul state (1991–93). She returned to government
  work in 1993 as secretary of mines, energy, and communications for Rio Grande do Sul, and she was credited with increasing energy 
  efficiency and power production within the state. Rousseff left that post in 1994 and later pursued a Ph.D. in economics. 
  Before receiving the degree, however, she was called back to her former government post in 1999, and it was there that she
   became affiliated with Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s Workers’ Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores; PT). Her standing in the party
    quickly rose, and she left her government job in 2002 to serve on the staff of Lula’s successful presidential campaign.

  <h6 class="bio-header">Presidency</h6>
  <p class="bio-para">
  Rousseff outlined a domestic agenda that focused on the maintenance of economic stability, poverty eradication, political 
  reform, tax reform, and job creation. Her foreign policy stressed human rights, multilateralism, peace, and nonintervention.
   In August she launched a new industrial policy, “Larger Brazil,” that included “buy Brazilian” provisions and tax cuts for industry.
    In November she signed a landmark law that established a truth commission to investigate the disappearances and human rights abuses
     during military rule.
     <br><br>
     Throughout 2011, Rousseff’s administration faced accusations of corruption. By the end of 2011, investigations into multiple
      allegations of corruption and the possibility of congressional inquiries had led to the resignation of five cabinet ministers,
       all holdovers from the Lula administration. In November 2012 six more Brazilian government officials were arrested on charges
        of influence peddling and corruption. Rousseff fired two of them. Meanwhile, the trial of the largest political corruption
         scandal in Brazilian history was winding down. The case, dubbed the mensalão (“big monthly bribe”), involved a scheme to 
         bribe members of the Chamber of Deputies, and it was alleged that Lula had been involved.
         <br><br>
All this occurred as the Brazilian economy cooled down considerably, with the gross domestic product slipping from a growth rate of
 about 7.5 percent in 2010 to 1.0 percent growth in 2012. In response, the central bank pursued an aggressive policy of interest-rate
  reduction and lowered the reserve requirement for Brazilian banks, which injected liquidity into the economy, helping to keep the 
  unemployment rate low and buoying Rousseff’s popularity. In September 2012, under pressure from industry to cut the costs of 
  electricity, Rousseff announced a “provisional measure” that created a mechanism to reduce energy prices by an average of about
   20 percent and renewed for up to 30 years the concessions from electricity plants set to expire in 2015–17.
<br><br>
Brazil’s political landscape was transformed by massive, sometimes violent street protests that began in São Paulo in June 2013 
and spread throughout the country. The demonstrations were staged mainly by a growing middle class that was increasingly anxious
 about government corruption, the country’s disappointing economic performance, and poor delivery of public services, especially
  in light of the billions spent by the government on infrastructure and to build and upgrade stadiums for the football (soccer) 
  World Cup competition that the country would host in 2014 and Summer Olympic Games that Rio de Janiero was scheduled to host in 
  2016. Rousseff’s response to the unrest included a controversial plan to attempt to remedy Brazil’s shortage of physicians by
   bringing in foreign doctors, especially from Cuba. The demonstrations contributed to a drop in Rousseff’s approval rating from 
   65 percent to 30 percent at one point during 2013.<br><br>
In September 2013, revelations by former Central Intelligence Agency analyst Edward Snowden of U.S. intelligence monitoring of 
e-mails of Rousseff, her fellow citizens, and Petrobras led to the postponement of what would have been the first state visit by a 
Brazilian leader to Washington in more than 18 years, straining a relationship that both countries had worked hard to improve. 
Speaking at the United Nations (UN) at the end of September, Rousseff openly criticized the U.S. spying activities and proposed
 the creation of a UN-based regulatory framework for the Internet.
 <br><br>
As the staging of the World Cup itself went largely according to plan, Rousseff’s popularity rebounded. The Brazilian team did
 Rousseff no favour, however, when it suffered arguably the worst loss in the country’s illustrious World Cup history, falling to 
 Germany 7–1 in a semifinal match and turning the attention of the football-crazy country back to its social and economic ills. 
 (The Brazilian economy had slid into recession at the beginning of 2014.) Nevertheless, Rousseff appeared to have a solid lead in
  the preference polling for the upcoming first round of presidential elections—until the Brazilian Socialist Party candidate, 
  Eduardo Campos, died in a plane crash in August. 
  <br><br>
  He was replaced by his running mate, green activist Marina Silva, whose candidacy 
  seemed to resonate strongly with the electorate. Moreover, with the October 5 election approaching, Brazil refused to join more 
  than 150 other countries in signing an anti-deforestation pledge at the climate-change summit in New York City in September,
   claiming that the pledge had been drafted without Brazilian participation.
