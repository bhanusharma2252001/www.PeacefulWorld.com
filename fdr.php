<h6 class="bio-header">Who is Franklin Delano Roosevelt?</h6>
<p class="bio-para">Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the 32nd American president. FDR, as he was often called, led the United States 
through the Great Depression and World War II, and greatly expanding the powers of the federal government through a series of
 programs and reforms known as the New Deal. 
Stricken with polio in 1921, Roosevelt spent much of his adult life in a wheelchair. A whole generation of Americans grew up 
knowing no other president, as FDR served an unprecedented four terms in office. Rooseveltâ€™s social programs reinvented the role 
of government in Americans' lives, while his presidency during World War II established the United States' leadership on the world 
stage.</p>
  <h6 class="bio-header">Personal life</h6>
    <p class="bio-para">Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, in Hyde Park, New York. He was born into a wealthy family as the only 
    child of James Roosevelt and Sara Ann Delano Roosevelt, and a distant cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt. 
The Roosevelts had been prominent for several generations, having made their fortune in real estate and trade, and lived at 
Springwood, their estate in the Hudson River Valley of New York State.
While growing up, Roosevelt was surrounded by privilege and a sense of self-importance. 

He was educated by tutors and governesses until age 14, and the entire household revolved around him, with his mother being 
the dominant figure in his life even into adulthood. His upbringing was very unlike the common people whom he would later champion.

In 1896, Roosevelt attended Groton School for boys, a prestigious Episcopal preparatory school in Massachusetts. The experience was 
a difficult one for him, as he did not fit in with the other students. Groton men excelled in athletics and Roosevelt did not. 

He strived to please the adults and took to heart the teachings of Groton's headmaster, Endicott Peabody, who urged students to 
help the less fortunate through public service.

  <h6 class="bio-header">National Politics</h6>
  <p class="bio-para">In 1914, Roosevelt decided to run for the U.S. Senate seat for New York. The proposition was doomed from the start
  , as he lacked White House support. President Wilson needed the Democratic political machine to get his social reforms passed and
   ensure his re-election.
He could not support Roosevelt, who had made too many political enemies among New York Democrats. Roosevelt was soundly defeated in 
the primary election and learned a valuable lesson that national stature could not defeat a well-organized local political organization.
till, Roosevelt took to Washington politics and found his career thriving as he developed more personal relationships. 
At the 1920 Democratic Convention, he accepted the nomination for vice president, as James M. Cox's running mate. The pair was 
soundly defeated by Republican Warren G. Harding in the general election, but the experience gave Roosevelt national exposure.
Roosevelt repaired his relationship with New York's Democratic political machine. He appeared at the 1924 and 1928 Democratic 
National Conventions to nominate New York governor Al Smith for president, which increased his national exposure.
