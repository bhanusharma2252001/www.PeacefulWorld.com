  <h6 class="bio-header">Personal life</h6>
    <p class="bio-para">Barack Hussein Obama II was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961. Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr.,
     was born of Luo ethnicity in Nyanza Province, Kenya. Obama Sr. grew up herding goats in Africa and eventually earned a scholarship
     
      that allowed him to leave Kenya and pursue his dreams of going to college in Hawaii.


Obama’s mother, Ann Dunham, was born on an Army base in Wichita, Kansas, during World War II. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor,
nham's father, Stanley, enlisted in the military and marched across Europe in General George Patton's army. Dunham's mother, Madelyn, 
went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, the couple studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through the Federal Housing
 Program and, after several moves, ended up in Hawaii.

While studying at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Obama Sr. met fellow student Ann Dunham. They married on February 2, 1961, 
and Barack II was born six months later.

His father left soon after his birth, and the couple divorced two years later. In 1965, Dunham married Lolo Soetoro, a University
 of Hawaii student from Indonesia. A year later, the family moved to Jakarta, Indonesia, where Obama's half-sister, Maya Soetoro Ng,
  was born in 1970. Several incidents in Indonesia left Dunham afraid for her son's safety and education so, at the age of 10, Obama 
  was sent back to Hawaii to live with his maternal grandparents. His mother and half-sister later joined them.


As a child, Obama did not have a relationship with his father. When his son was still an infant, Obama Sr. relocated to Massachusetts
 to attend Harvard University and pursue a Ph.D. Obama's parents officially separated several months later and ultimately divorced in
  March 1964, when their son was two. Soon after, Obama Sr. returned to Kenya.

Obama struggled with the absence of his father during his childhood, who he saw only once more after his parents divorced when Obama
 Sr. visited Hawaii for a short time in 1971. "[My father] had left paradise, and nothing that my mother or grandparents told me could
  obviate that single, unassailable fact," he later reflected. "They couldn't describe what it might have been like had he stayed."

While living with his grandparents, Obama enrolled in the esteemed Punahou Academy. He excelled in basketball and graduated with 
academic honors in 1979. As one of only three Black students at the school, he became conscious of racism and what it meant to be
 African American.

Obama later described how he struggled to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage with his own sense of self: 
"I noticed that there was nobody like me in the Sears, Roebuck Christmas catalog. . .and that Santa was a white man," he wrote. 
"I went into the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror with all my senses and limbs seemingly intact, looking as I had always
 looked, and wondered if something was wrong with me."

  <h6 class="bio-header">First Book and Grammy</h6>
  <p class="bio-para">
Obama published his autobiography, Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance, in 1995. The work received high praise
 from literary figures such as Toni Morrison. It has since been printed in more than 25 languages, including Chinese, Swedish and
  Hebrew. The book had a second printing in 2004 and was adapted for a children's version.

The audiobook version of Dreams, narrated by Obama, received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word album in 2006.
